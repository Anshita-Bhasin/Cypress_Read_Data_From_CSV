Cypress_Read_Data_From_CSV

This project demonstrates how to automate the user registration process in Cypress,
The test data for the registration form is sourced from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, enabling us to test multiple scenarios with ease. 
Additionally, we use the Faker API from the Faker.js library to generate unique and random email addresses for each test run.
