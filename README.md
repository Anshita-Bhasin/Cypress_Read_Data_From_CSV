Cypress_Read_Data_From_CSV

This project demonstrates how to automate the user registration process in Cypress.

The test data for the registration form is sourced from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, enabling us to test multiple scenarios with ease. 
Additionally, I have used the Faker API from the Faker.js library to generate unique and random email addresses for each test run.
